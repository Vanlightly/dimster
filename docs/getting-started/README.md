# Getting Started with Dimster

A hands-on walkthrough that takes you from an empty laptop to your first finished Dimster benchmark on a local Kubernetes cluster — and then nudges you toward the four benchmark modes and a beefier local environment.

## Who this is for

You are a developer who:

- Knows their way around the command line.
- Already understands Kafka basics (topics, partitions, producers, consumers).
- Is **new to Kubernetes** or new to Dimster.

If any of that is wildly off, these pages will still work — they just spend more time hand-holding the Kubernetes parts than a Kubernetes expert would want.

> Operating systems covered here: **macOS** and **Linux**. Windows is not covered (use WSL2 if you must, but it isn't tested).

## How to read this

Follow the numbered files in order on your first pass. Each step depends on the previous one and most commands assume you're at the project root.

After you've finished page 10 you'll have:

- A working local benchmarking lab.
- A `dimster-config.yaml` you can edit and grow.
- Hands-on experience with each of the four benchmark modes.
- A clean teardown path between sessions.

Page 11 is an optional side path for when you want to run a benchmark without Kubernetes at all — useful for CI smoke tests and quick local repros, but with reduced capabilities.

## Where to go next

For real benchmarks, you'll need to deploy to a real Kubernetes cluster. Read the [Deploying Dimster](../deployment/) section, which covers:

- The mental model: what Dimster expects from any Kubernetes cluster, and how `dimster-config.yaml` maps to k8s resources.
- The two deploy modes (`full` vs `external`) and when to use each.
- Why `nodeLabel` and `pvcStorageClass` are required for any benchmark whose numbers you'd publish.
- Per-target guides: AWS EKS (with the `eks-setup` wizard), GCP/Azure/on-prem, and external Kafka services like Confluent Cloud and MSK.

Also:

- [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md) — every flag for every command.
- [`dimster-config.yaml` Reference](../reference/dimster-config.md) — full schema.
- [Workload Reference](../reference/workloads.md) — every workload field.
- [Dimensional Testing](../concepts/dimensional-testing.md) — sweep parameters across many runs.
